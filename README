# Prism

## Overview
**Prism** is an IaA (Infrastructure as API) platform. that provides unified API interfaces for multi-cloud through EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) model-based Terraform trasform, Prism provides schema-free, provider-agnostic infrastructure operations across multi-cloud environments.

**Inspired by:** [WeCube Terraform Plugin](https://github.com/WeBankPartners/wecube-plugins-terraform) - evolved with modern API design and flexible data modeling.

## Concept

Prism unifies these differences into standard APIs through an abstraction layer:


```
User API Request
    ↓
Prism (Unified API)
    ↓
Terraform (Multi-Cloud)
    ↓
AWS | GCP | Tencent Cloud | Alibaba Cloud | Kubernetes | Openstack | ...
```

## Key Innovations
- Multi-Cloud Platform Engineering.
- Dynamic EAV Model Architecture.
    - Schema-free resource modeling supporting any cloud provider without database migrations.
- Safe
    - Safe operations with built-in validation, state management, and rollback mechanisms.
    - Provider abstraction layer hiding cloud-specific complexities.
